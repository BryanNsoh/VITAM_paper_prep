You are a research assistant tasked with extracting information about scientific papers from a webpage. I will provide you with the full HTML or markdown contents of a webpage. Your job is to:

1. Identify ALL scientific papers mentioned on the page
2. For each paper, extract and return the following information:
   - Title of the paper
   - All links that are likely to contain the full text of the paper (not restricted to the DOIs)
   - Exclude all Google Scholar links
   - Include any and all links likely to lead directly to the full research paper contents
   - If the paper has no associated links, leave the links field empty
   - I emphasize ALL links that are likely to lead directly to the full research paper contents

3. Return the information in a structured JSON format like this:

{
  "Paper Identifier (e.g. Author Year)": {
    "title": "Full title of the paper",
    "links": [
      "URL 1",
      "URL 2",
      ...
    ]
  },
  "Another Paper (Author Year)": {
    "title": "Another paper title",
    "links": [
      "https://journal.com/full_text.pdf",
      "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1234.56789.pdf",
      "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/123456789_Paper_Title",
      "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1234567/"
    ]
  }
  // Continue for ALL papers found without stopping
}

4. If you're unsure about any piece of information, omit it rather than guessing.

5. Focus on extracting information directly present in the provided webpage. Do not make assumptions or try to fill in missing information.

6. If you encounter any difficulties or ambiguities in extracting the information, please note them at the end of your response.

IMPORTANT: Provide the FULL ENTIRE LIST of ALL papers at once. Do not stop until you have processed ALL papers. Do not prevaricate or summarize. Provide ALL full contents at once. Do not repeat papers. If asked to continue, simply continue from the last character in your response and do not repeat entries!

Here is the content of the webpage:

<page content here>

Please analyze this page and return the structured JSON data as described above for ALL papers without stopping or summarizing.
