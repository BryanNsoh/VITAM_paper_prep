The S-V equations, which precisely model the dynamics of open-channel systems, are quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) without analytical solutions. Directly applying the S-V equations to an MPC controller design becomes sophisticated. In this work, the calculus of variation is used to obtain the adjoint equations and the adjoint analysis method is utilized to deduce the gradients of the MPC optimization problem. Particularly, the physical constraints involving both the state and control variables are also considered. A gradient-based optimization algorithm in combination with the numerical computation of Preissmann implicit scheme is proposed to solve the constrained MPC optimization problem. The control performances of the developed PDE-constrained MPC algorithm with respect to the controlled water levels and gate openings are compared with those of the MPC controller designed for the linearized model. All the simulation tests are carried out on an aqueduct reach in Yehe Irrigation District in Hebei Province, China. The results show that the proposed PDE-constrained MPC algorithm is a promising method in dealing with the constraints in terms of hyperbolic PDEs, control variables and state variables simultaneously. 1 INTRODUCTION Open-channel systems, which mean canals with free surface, are widely built on the farms and under the cities for the purpose of irrigation or drainage. As a distributed parameter system, the dynamics of an open channel is modelled by a set of quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations(PDEs) formulated by de Saint-Venant [ 1 ]. Since the Saint-Venant (S-V) equations have not been solved analytically yet, they are difficult to utilize directly in controller design. Therefore, researchers have developed various methods to overcome this issue, which are now widely used in practice. The classical proportional–integral (PI) and the proportion–integration–differentiation (PID) controllers have been widely used in the industrial control field for decades because it does not require a mathematical model of the controlled systems. They have been also used in cascaded open-channel systems to avoid the unsolvable S-V equations [ 2 , 3 ]. However, the method of eliminating errors by error feedback is challenging when dealing with the coupling between variables in multi-input and multi-output problems. Additionally, it may not provide satisfactory performance when dealing with strong nonlinearity [ 4 ]. As a result, the development of model-based control approaches becomes necessary. In order to improve the control performance of an open-channel system, simplified models and model-based schemes were considered. The integrator-delay (ID) model was proposed [ 5 ] and used to design a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller [ 6 ]. The integrator resonance (IR) model was established with preferable performance for describing open-channel dynamics compared to the ID model [ 7 ]. The state transition equations derived by discretization and linearization of the S-V equations were used for LQR control [ 8 , 9 ]. The ordinary differential equations model was developed by a control parameterization method [ 10 ]. A reduced order model based on the S-V equations was proposed with the WKB method [ 11 ]. These simplified models used in finite-dimensional control weaken the representation of the infinite-dimensional dynamics present in the distributed system. In contrast, an infinite-dimensional control approach has the potential to achieve better control performance due to its higher model precision. To explore an infinite-dimensional control, the original S-V equations were taken into account. By means of a Lyapunov function [ 12 ] or a Riemann invariants approach [ 13 , 14 ], the boundary feedback control obtain control laws that guarantee the stability of controlled systems. A backstepping boundary control is designed to convert the PDE to a linear form and achieve the exponential stability [ 15 ]. However, the boundary feedback control methods mentioned in the above literature are more focused on stability rather than optimality. In practical applications of open-channel systems, the emphasis is on efficiency and water conservation, that is, how to achieve optimal system operation. Therefore, model predictive control (MPC) is considered to address these concerns. MPC is a model-based optimal control framework and widely used in industrial processes [ 16 , 17 ]. MPC solves a finite-horizon static optimization problem at each sampling time to obtain an optimal control sequence and injects the first move into the system [ 18 ]. The MPC schemes were proposed for open-channel systems based on the ID model [ 19 ], the IR model [ 20 ], the CARIMA model [ 21 ], and simplified S-V model [ 22 ]. The distributed MPC [ 23 ], hierarchical MPC [ 24 ], and multiple MPC [ 25 ] were also developed for open-channel systems. A stochastic MPC strategy based on Gaussian processes was applied to drinking water networks [ 26 ]. The MPC methods were also considered in the distributed parameter systems. By the methods of lines and orthogonal collocation, a spatial-temporal discretization model is established and used to solve a nonlinear programming problem [ 27 ]. An MPC controller of a linear parabolic PDE is designed by decomposing the PDE model according to its eigenvalues [ 28 ]. By combining the adjoint method and variation calculus, an infinite-dimensional MPC control for the S–V equations is developed [ 29 ]. Ref. [ 29 ] considered open-channel systems with rectangular sections and did not take constraints into account, while handling constraints is one of the major advantages of MPC. This paper focuses on an MPC algorithm for open-channel systems based on the S–V equations. The objective is to regulate the water level of an open-channel system with a trapezoidal cross-section to a desired value by adjusting the gate opening, which serves as the control variable. Through the Lagrange multiplier approach, the objective functional connects with the PDE model. By variational calculus and necessary conditions of optimization, some adjoint PDEs related to the S–V equations and the gradients with respect to the control variables are derived. The optimal control sequence is calculated by a gradient-based optimization method such as the steepest descent method. One of the most notable features of MPC is the capability to deal with constraints. In this work, the upper and lower bound constraints imposed on the state and control variables due to physical construction are taken into account. The state constraints are handled as soft constraints and the violation of the state constraints would be penalized in the objective functional by an external point penalty function method. The control constraints are considered when deriving the optimization conditions by using the Lagrangian multiplier method. The optimization procedure is implemented by repeating the gradient-based descent until the optimization conditions are nearly satisfied. Compared with the literature [ 29 ], the proposed algorithm considers open-channel systems with trapezoidal sections (where a rectangle is a special case of a trapezoid), and the control action involves the gate opening rather than its derivative. Additionally, this paper focuses on the detailed handling of constraints. The following statements represent the main contributions of this paper. Firstly, this paper develops an MPC algorithm that directly utilizes the S-V equations, aiming to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of employing S-V equations directly for control purposes. Secondly, the physical constraints occurring at the state and control variables are dealt with in the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is designed as an infinite-dimensional control pattern, making it applicable to other distributed parameter systems as well. The construction of this paper is as follows. The S-V equations and MPC problem are stated in Section 2 . Section 3 mainly demonstrates our constrained MPC algorithm. In Section 4 , an example is tested the validity of proposed algorithm. Section 5 summarizes this paper. 2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 2.1 Saint-Venant equations A one-reach open-channel system is considered, as shown in Figure 1 . This reach is controlled by two underflow gates. The upstream and downstream water levels outside the reach denoted by and are kept constant. The opening heights of the two underflow gates are denoted by . The dynamics of such an open-channel system is governed by the S-V equations when neglecting the friction as follows. (1) where is the spatial coordinate along the flow orientation of a canal. L is the length. is the time coordinate. and denote the water level and flow discharge respectively at space x and time t . g is the gravity coefficient. is the wetted area of the cross-section at x . Under the assumption that the shape of the cross-section is constant, A is relevant to the water level H . Without loss of generality, we consider the open-channel system with trapezoidal cross-section. Thus the wetted area A can be expressed as (2) where B is the canal width and Z is the side slope. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A one-reach open-channel system limited by two underflow gates. The discharge at the i th underflow gate is expressed as a formulation with the gate opening. (3) where Q is the flow discharge at the gate, the opening height is the control variable. is the flow coefficient. w is the gate width. is the difference of water levels on both sides of the gate. Equation ( 3 ) is called the boundary conditions of the S-V equations. The initial conditions at time are denoted as (4) For the sake of safety, the underflow gates are always moved in a safe range. The gate openings are confined to a feasible range denoted by and which depend on the geometry construction. (5) By introducing the vectors u , , and defined as follows Let (6) where U is the Hilbert space. Equation ( 5 ) is rewritten as (7) In the delivery of water in open-channel systems, if the water level exceeds the height of the bank, the water overflows inevitably. Serious overflowing causes not only waste of water but also dam collapse and flooding. During the water transportation of the open-channel systems, the water level should be constrained by the bank height . (8) Similar to the expression of Equation ( 7 ), let then Equation ( 8 ) is rewritten as (9) 2.2 Objective functional In order to satisfy the water demand for irrigation, on the one hand, the water level in the open reach is expected to keep a desired value quickly. On the other hand, the gate openings cannot be changed frequently. Thus the objective functional consists of two parts and is defined as follows. (10) where T 1 is the prediction horizon and T 2 is the control horizon. In order to facilitate the solution of PDE problem, usually T 1 is equal to T 2 , ( ). is the desired water level. is the weighting factor. The first term penalties the discrepancy between the real water level and desired one. The second term penalties the control actions. 2.3 Formulation of PDE-constrained model predictive control with control and state constraints The principle of MPC could be stated as follows. At each optimization procedure, an MPC controller generates an optimal solution by solving a finite-horizon static optimization problem and applying the first one to the plant. This procedure is repeated at each sampling time. In this sense, MPC is also called receding horizon control. A formulation of the continuous MPC algorithm with constraints of PDEs, control and state variables is depicted in the following Algorithm 1 . ALGORITHM 1. MPC algorithm with constraints of PDEs, control and state variables Repeat the following steps at each control horizon : Step I Measure the current state as the initial conditions. Step II Solve the finite horizon optimization problem (11) Step III Apply the value of u ( t ) at the first time to the plant. As depicted in Algorithm 1 , an MPC scheme is implemented by solving the static optimization problem of Equation ( 11 ) repeatedly as time recedes. The S-V equations formulate the prediction model that predicts the future dynamics with undetermined control. Since the S-V equations are unsolvable analytically, a framework based on the adjoint analysis method is established to solve the optimization problem in Equation ( 11 ). By applying the Lagrange multiplier method and variational calculation, the gradients of the objective functional with respect to the control variables are derived. The optimization solution is obtained through the gradient-based search scheme. 3 CONSTRAINED MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL ALGORITHM 3.1 Solution of PDE-constrained optimization problem Firstly, we consider the optimization problem with the constraints of the S-V equations. When dealing with a PDE-constrained optimization problem, the classical tools like Pontryagin's minimum principle and dynamic programming are helpless. A framework based on the adjoint analysis method is established. By applying the Lagrange multiplier method, the Lagrange function is formulated by incorporating Equation ( 1 ) into the objective functional of Equation ( 10 ). (12) where where is the Lagrange multiplier. By applying the variational principle to Equation ( 12 ), it yields the variation of the objective functional as follows (13) where is the wetted perimeter. The boundary conditions of Equation ( 3 ) are rewritten as (14) Similarly by applying the variational principle to Equation ( 14 ) again, it follows that (15) By substituting Equation ( 15 ) into Equation ( 13 ), we obtain (16) where denotes . From the optimization necessity conditions, the variations of the Lagrange functional of Equation ( 16 ) with respect to the water level H , discharge Q and their boundaries are set to zero. By setting the variations and to zero, the adjoint equations are obtained as (17) By setting the variations with respect to the boundary water levels and to zero, the adjoint boundary conditions are obtained as (18) The partial derivatives of the Lagrange functional of Equation ( 15 ) with respect to the control variables are derived as (19) The remaining terms of in Equation ( 16 ) are rewritten as (20) Since the original variables H and Q at time are specified as the initial conditions, the transversality conditions of the adjoint variables are obtained as (21) 3.2 Penalty of state constraints In this paper, we consider the box constraints (upper and lower bound constraints) of state and control variables. In this subsection, we focus on the state constraints. When regulating a real open-channel system, we hope the water level tracks a desired value quickly without surpassing the bank height, which means a waste of water. To trade off the tracking task and the thought of reducing waste of water, the constraints of water level are handled as soft constraints. An external point penalty function method is applied to this situation. The penalty function method enforces the satisfaction of constraints by adding a penalty term to the objective function, penalizing the violation of constraints. The objective functional of Equation ( 10 ) is modified as (22) where (23) where σ is the penalty factor. Thus the adjoint equations ( 17 ) become (24) where (25) 3.3 Optimality conditions for control constraints Let us consider the following optimization problem with control constraints. (26) If is a local solution of Equation ( 26 ), then the optimization condition holds (27) The condition of Equation ( 27 ) is called variational inequality. When is convex on , Equation ( 27 ) is the sufficient and necessary condition for the global optimization. For the case of box constraints, the optimization condition can be simplified as follows. Theorem 1. If u * is a solution of Equation ( 24 ), is formulated as Equation ( 6 ), then u * satisfies the optimization condition as follows. There are with (28) Proof. Firstly, from Equation ( 27 ), it can obtained that (29) Let , . Then and hold trivially. When , because of Equation ( 29 ), . By the definition of , and . Similarly when , then and . When or , Equation ( 28 ) hold obviously. The proof is done. The gradients in Equation ( 19 ) involve the water level H and discharge Q as well as the adjoint variables . They could be calculated after the S-V equations in Equation ( 1 ) and the adjoint equations in Equation ( 24 ) are numerically solved by the Preissmann implicit difference method. The optimal control sequences are generated by repeating a gradient descent method until the optimization conditions in Equation ( 28 ) are satisfied. This gradient-based MPC algorithm is developed in Algorithm 2 . ALGORITHM 2. Gradient-based MPC algorithm with constraints of PDEs, control and state variables Repeat the following steps at each control horizon : Step I Measure the current state as the initial conditions. Step II Solve the finite horizon optimization problem according to the following iterations. Step 1.

Increase the index , return to step II.2. step III Apply the values of and at the first time to the plant. 4 SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Numerical computation by Preissmann implicit difference It is obvious that both the adjoint equations and the original ones are hyperbolic PDEs. The numerical solutions can be achieved by the classical Preissmann implicit difference method [ 30 ]. The sketch is as shown in Figure 2 . The Preissmann scheme has been validated to be stable unconditionally for any time step when parameters are adjusted suitably. The standard four-point format has the following form. (30) where f denotes an arbitrary function of x and t . and is the space and time steps respectively. α and β are weight factors that submit to . denotes . The unconditional stability is guaranteed when . FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Preissmann four-point scheme. 4.2 Comparisons of MPC with and without physical constraints In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed infinite-dimensional MPC algorithm with constraints, an MPC controller with state and control constraints as well as the unconstrained version are tested in a one-reach open-channel system whose parameters are extracted from a canal in Yehe Irrigation District in North China [ 10 ]. The pictures of the aqueduct reach and the underflow gate in Yehe irrigation are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . The geometry parameters are shown in Table 1 and hydraulic parameters are shown in Table 2 . TABLE  1. Geometry parameters.

Hydraulic Initial Initial parameters discharge water level Values 2.00 m 1.00 m 1.50 m FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The aqueduct reach. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Downstream underflow gate of the aqueduct reach. The simulation experiences are proceeded on the software SICC 5.34a, which is a powerful tool to simulate the channel systems. The control programs are compiled in MATLAB 2008a. The computer has a configuration of Intel Core i3-7100 3.90GHz CPU, 8GB Ram, and WIN 7 64 bit operating system. The parameters of Preissmann scheme are set as and . The spatial coordinate is separated into 8 intervals when discretization. So there are 9 sampling points and the distance between every two is 125 m. The simulation time is 120 min. It is assumed that the water level is governed to 1.70 m in the first 60 min and 1.60 m in the last 60 min. The weight matrices are set to unit ones of equivalent order. The maximum iteration of solving optimization problem is 30 which is suitable and enough. The control horizon is set to 4. In constrained scenario, the control and state variables are constrained in very small ranges as shown in Table 3 . For convenience of expression, the water level with only three sampling points, whose spatial coordinates are 0, 500, 1000 respectively, are displayed. The simulation results of two algorithms are shown in Figures 5 and 6 . TABLE  3. Control and state constraints ( ). Constraints Values 0.10 m 1.10 m 1.50 m 1.75 m FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evolutions of water levels under MPC controller with and without physical constraints. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Gate openings of MPC controller with and without physical constraints. As shown in Figure 5 , the water levels are regulated to the desired value by proposed algorithms. By unconstrained MPC algorithm, the water level at the middle point exceeds 1.80 m. While by the constrained algorithm, the water level is limited under the maximum value, 1.75 m. In Figure 6 , the gate openings are operated within the admired range, m by using the constrained algorithm. While by the unconstrained algorithm, the opening of the first gate exceeds 1.10 m. These results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in dealing with the state and control constraints. Remark 1. The inner point penalty function method, whose penalty function is defined by , is also considered in this work. The inner point method leads to an intrinsic static-state error. This error can be reduced as σ decreases, but cannot be eliminated. Considering that in open channel systems the water level needs to be driven to a specified value precisely, the external point scheme is adopted instead. 4.3 Comparisons of MPC for S-V equations and linearized model For the purpose of discussing the effect of model precision on control performance, the developed MPC controller for the S-V equations model and physical constraints as well as a centralized MPC controller for a linearized model are carried out in this subsection. The linearized model is developed in a state-space form by linearizing and discretizing the S-V equations in both space and time [ 22 ]. Under a set of random control inputs, the water levels calculated by two models are shown in Figure 7 , where the blue solid line represents the computational result of the SICC software, the red dotted line represents the S-V equations and the green broken line refers to the linearized model. Obviously, the prediction of the S-V equations is closer to the true trajectory compared to the linearized model. The mean square errors between the two models and the true trajectory ( ) at each time point are calculated. The result is shown in Table 4 . The control performance of two controllers are shown in Figure 8 . TABLE  4. Prediction errors of S-V equations and linearized model. Models S-V equations linearized model 0.0031 0.0251 FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of prediction accuracy between S-V equations and linearized model. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evolutions of water levels under MPC with S-V equations and linearized model. As shown in Figure 8 , the water levels are driven to the desired value over time by both MPC controllers with the S-V equations model and the linearized model. However, the developed MPC method with the S-V equations model achieves both smaller overshoot and shorter settling time compared to the linearized model. The mean square errors between the actual water levels and the desired value ( ) at each time point are calculated. The result is shown in Table 5 . TABLE  5. Control errors between actual and desired values of water levels. Models S-V equations linearized model 0.0084 0.0115 Obviously, the dynamic performance of the developed method is markedly preferable than the linearized model. These results demonstrate that the developed PDE-constrained MPC algorithm improves the control performance compared to the control method designed for the linearized S-V model. In the simulation cases, the computation time for each control action using the MPC with the S-V model takes about 5–8 s, which is longer than the computation time with the linearized model. In most cases in Yehe River, the actuation period of the gate opening in open-channel systems is longer than 10 min, ensuring our algorithm well-suited for practical applications. 5 CONCLUSION In this paper, a PDE-constrained MPC algorithm with physical constraints is presented. As the model of open-channel systems, the S-V partial differential equations are directly used to design the MPC controller without any simplification. In addition, the constraints about the gate openings and water levels are explicitly considered in the solution of the MPC optimization problem. By applying the variational principle to the cost functional and boundary conditions, a gradient-based optimization method is derived to solve the PDE-constrained optimization problem with control and state constraints in the framework of adjoint analysis. The simulation results carried out on a real-world open-channel in Yehe Irrigated District show that the proposed algorithm conducted on the S-V model improve the control performance compared that performed on the simplified model. Although there have been some related discussions in the literature [ 31 - 33 ], the stability issue of general MPC for hyperbolic PDEs remains an challenging question. We will focus on the stability of MPC for the S-V model in the future work. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Yongfang Xie: Funding acquisition, project administration.
