during pregnancy: a qualitative systematic 
review

Abstract 
Background  Social support during pregnancy can alleviate emotional and physical pressures, improving the well-
being of mother and child. Understanding women’s lived experiences and perceptions of social support during preg‑
nancy is imperative to better support women. This systematic review explores and synthesises the qualitative research 
on women’s experiences of social support during pregnancy.
Methods  Databases PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo and Scopus were searched with no year limit. Eligible 
studies included pregnant women or women who were up to one year postpartum and were assessed on their expe‑
riences of social support during pregnancy. The data were synthesised using the thematic synthesis approach.
Results  Fourteen studies were included with data from 571 participating women across ten countries; two stud‑
ies used focus groups, and 12 used interviews to collect their data. Four main themes were developed (’a variety 
of emotional support’, ’tangible and intangible instrumental support’, ’traditional rituals and spiritual support’, and ’the 
all-encompassing natal home’), and six sub-themes (’female network connections’, ’care and affection from the hus‑
band’, ’dissatisfaction with relationships’, ’financial support from the husband and family’, ’practical support from family 
and friends’, ’health information support’).
Conclusions  This systematic review sheds light on women’s experiences of social support during pregnancy. The 
results indicate a broad variety of emotional support experienced and valued by pregnant women from different 
sources. Additionally, women expressed satisfaction and dissatisfaction with tangible and intangible support forms. 
It was also highlighted that spirituality played an essential role in reducing stress and offering coping mechanisms 
for some, whereas spirituality increased stress levels for others.

Background
For some women, pregnancy is considered a time of joy, 
but it also involves many well-being, social, and physi-
cal changes (e.g., emotional, physiological, and relational 
changes). These changes during pregnancy can present 
many challenges [1–3]. For example, Yin et  al. [4] con-
ducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence 
of antenatal depression during pregnancy across sev-
eral continents. The results showed that the prevalence 
rates of any antenatal depression were 20.7%, and 15%

of pregnant women experienced major antenatal depres-
sion, which is higher than general population 14.5% [5]. 
Other challenges reported in the existing literature are 
related to unplanned pregnancy, mood instability, physi-
cal health problems, financial problems, and a lack of 
social support during pregnancy [6–9]. For example, 
social support during pregnancy reportedly helps to 
alleviate the pressures of the pregnant women’s emo-
tional and physical changes, and suggests to improve the 
mother and child’s well-being [10–12].
The conceptualisation of social support
There is a wide range of literature connected to social 
support from many perspectives and disciplines over 
many decades of research [13–16]. Social support has 
broadly been outlined as a complex, multi-dimensional 
concept that can be defined as assistance provided by a 
person’s social network and involves the provision of 
emotional and physical support [16, 17]. However, from 
a traditional psychological perspective, Cohen and Wills 
[13] describe social support as support from social net-
works that can influence health through two pathways 
(direct effects and stress buffering). The direct-effect 
hypothesis suggests that social support can improve 
health regardless of whether the environment is stressful 
or not [18]. Further, it contributes to a sense of belong-
ing and stability, resulting in improved self-esteem and 
reduced stress and mental health disorders [19]. Alter-
natively, the stress-buffering hypothesis posits that sup-
port may buffer against unhealthy reactions and provide 
the individual with access to additional resources that 
will enhance their capacity to cope with stressful events 
in two ways:
1.	 Perceived support can prevent a psychological or 
physiological stress reaction from arising when a 
potentially stressful event occurs. Consequently, per-
ceived support may increase the perception that indi-
viduals can cope with negative events.
2.	 Perceived social support can intervene between the 
event of a stress reaction and the onset of a patholog-
ical process by reducing the stress reaction [19, 20].
Social support during pregnancy
Kroelinger and Oths [21] explored the role of social sup-
port in wanted and unwanted pregnancies. The results 
indicated that unwanted pregnancies are strongly influ-
enced by factors such as support from partners, the 
partner’s stability and status, and their feelings towards 
pregnancy. Therefore, Kroelinger and Oths highlights the 
potential role of a partner’s social support during preg-
nancy and shows how the lack of a partner’s support, 
particularly their emotional and practical support, can 
negatively affect women’s experiences by leading them 
to experience the pregnancy as unwanted. However, 
although, the relationship between a partner’s social sup-
port and whether a pregnancy is desirable seems simple, 
a person may decide that they want the pregnancy while 
it progresses based on certain discoveries, experiences, 
or events that are unrelated to the social support they 
receive from their partner. For example, parental social 
support can buffer the negative impacts of an unsupport-
ive partner [22].
Likewise, Rini et al. [23] aimed to assess their experi-
ences of the quality and quantity of social support they 
received from their partners, referred to as social support 
effectiveness (SSE). It focused on three functional types 
of social support: practical, emotional, and informational 
support. Greater SSE from partners predicted less anxi-
ety during the second to third trimesters [23]. In addi-
tion, a recent systematic review of social support during 
pregnancy sought to investigate the relationship between 
social support and mental illness during pregnancy. A 
significant positive correlation between low social sup-
port and antenatal depression (14/15 papers), antena-
tal anxiety (6/8 papers), and self-harm (3/4 papers) was 
found [6]. Although these studies stressed that social 
support directly affects mental health, the pregnant 
women’s feelings, attitudes, perspectives, and past preg-
nancy experiences may mediate the relationship between 
a partner’s social support and the pregnant person’s anxi-
ety [24]. This aligns with several studies that showed that 
those who perceive adequate social support during preg-
nancy are less likely to report stress, distress, or symp-
toms associated with anxiety and depression [25–27].
The above evidence demonstrates that social support 
may influence women’s experiences during pregnancy. 
However, more recent research has also incorporated 
contextual and situational factors associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Since December 2019, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all countries 
and territories and cases of COVID-19 increased expo-
nentially worldwide [28]. Recent research by Meaney 
et  al. [29] aimed to assess pregnant women’s percep-
tions and satisfaction with social support from an online 
survey conducted with 573 pregnant women during the 
pandemic from the US, Ireland, and the UK. The authors 
illustrated that a reduction in perceived social support 
that resulted from the lack of access to antenatal care 
during the COVID-19 pandemic increased negative feel-
ings such as sadness, anxiety, and loneliness during preg-
nancy for these women. Although this kind of research 
can help healthcare providers determine strategies to 
help women during stressful times, further research 
is required to identify the types of social support (e.g.,

Al‑Mutawtah et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:782 
	
emotional, instrumental, etc.) that were most affected by 
the pandemic.
In conclusion, the existing literature affirms that 
social support during pregnancy plays a role in women’s 
well-being and physical health (amongst other areas). 
However, most of these studies primarily employed quan-
titative approaches [21, 23, 30–32]. This indicates that the 
existing studies would have been unable to capture any 
wider contextual factors which may also shape women’s 
experiences, the emotional aspects of social support, or 
experiential aspects of the topic [33]. Therefore, qualita-
tive synthesis can provide an in-depth understanding of 
precious women’s experiences and perceptions of social 
support during pregnancy.
Overall aim
This systematic review sought to analyse and synthesise 
all available qualitative evidence about women’s experi-
ences of social support during pregnancy.
Research question
According to Stern et  al. [34] and Butler et  al. [35], to 
formulate a good question,  the four elements of the 
PICo (with a lowercase o) (as P referred to participants; 
I referred to phenomenon of interest; Co referred to 
context) mnemonic framework must be incorporated 
to identify the keywords to use in the review question. 
Table  1 outlines how the review research question was 
formulated using this framework.
Therefore, the research question developed via the 
PICo framework [35] was: How do women experience 
the social support provided to them during pregnancy?
Methods
Search strategy
An extensive literature search was conducted using five 
electronic databases: PubMed, CINAHL Plus with full 
text, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, and Scopus between May 
2022- February 2023. Shea et al. [49] notes that at least 
two databases should be searched for systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses; however, utilising more databases can 
yield more comprehensive and accurate results.
In addition, the Boolean connectors AND and OR 
were utilised to combine the following MeSH and search 
terms: “qualitative research”
, “qualitative”
, “qualitative 
method”
, “interview”
, “focus group”
, “social support”
, “psy-
chosocial support systems”
, “emotional support”
, “fam-
ily support”
, “practical support”
, “information support”
, 
“pregnancy”
, “pregnant”
. Furthermore, following Butler 
et al. [35], a manual screening of the reference lists of all 
included studies was performed to identify additional 
potential studies.
In addition, the Enhancing the Transparency of the 
Reported Comprehensive Qualitative Research State-
ment (ENTREQ), was used to increase transparency (see 
Additional file 1) [50].
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The included studies met the following criteria:
i)	 Original qualitative studies published in English-lan-
guage peer-reviewed journals with no year limit.
ii)	The participants were mainly adult women over 18, 
although two papers included two pregnant women 
aged 17 in their samples.
iii)	The participants were pregnant women or women 
who had given birth and were assessed on their expe-
rience of social support during pregnancy.
iv)	The participants were pregnant women that were not 
specifically recruited because of pre-existing health 
issues or mental illness, as these conditions may 
affect their social support experiences.
The exclusion criteria:
i)	 Pregnant under age 17.
ii)	Specific sub-groups of pregnant women (e.g., preg-
nant with HIV, diabetes, intellectual disabilities and 
visually impaired).
iii)	Social support in breastfeeding.
iv)	Unpublished and grey studies.
v)	 Theses and secondary research sources (e.g., 
reviews).
Data extraction
As part of the review process, researchers can extract 
descriptive data (e.g., details of setting or context) and 
outcome data (e.g., results or conclusions) from the 
selected studies [51]. The critical information needed to 
extract the context and participants are the study setting, 
country, population, and participant characteristics. The 
information needed to describe the research design and 
methods is the methods for data collection, analysis, and 
findings [50, 51]. The information we included in Table 2 
offers an overview of this data about the studies included 
in this review. A total of 14 international studies spanning 
1990 to 2022 have been selected, from the United States 
(n = 5), Canada (n = 1), Bangladesh (n = 1), Indonesia 
(n = 1), Iran (n = 1), Pakistan (n = 1), India (n = 1), Zam-
bia (n = 1), Nigeria (n = 1) and the UK (n = 1). In total, 571 
adult women participated; two studies used focus groups 
and 12 used interviews to collect their data.

Quality appraisal
A quality assessment of the studies included was con-
ducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme 
for Qualitative Studies Checklist (CASP). The CASP tool 
is endorsed by both Cochrane and the World Health 
Organization for the qualitative synthesis of evidence 
[61]. According to Butler et  al. [35], the scoring sys-
tem for the answers to each question was Yes = 1, Can’t 
tell = 0.5, and No = 0 points; high-quality papers earned 
9–10 points, moderate-quality papers, 7.5–9, and low-
quality papers, less than 7.5. The first author (MA) was 
the first appraiser and a second independent reviewer 
(MP) evaluated five randomised studies to verify the 
robustness of the process [62]. Next, the results were 
compared, and the reviewers’ assessments were found to 
be similar across the sample studies. Table 2 summarises 
the results of the critical appraisal.
Data and thematic synthesis
Thematic synthesis, developed by Thomas and Harden 
[63], was used to generate new insights from the primary 
studies. This approach consists of three stages: coding 
the text, developing descriptive themes, and generat-
ing analytical themes. This method provides an explicit 
process for reducing qualitative data by utilising differ-
ent reporting styles, such as thin descriptions and multi-
ple quotations [62, 64]. Each article’s results section was 
stored on a Word file and manually analysed using free 
line-by-line analysis. Then, these free codes were organ-
ised into  related areas to construct descriptive themes, 
and, ultimately, these were developed into analytical 
themes [65]. The coding process was conducted induc-
tively, and all of the preliminary codes and the descrip-
tive and analytical themes were discussed and refined by 
the independent reviewer (EC), between July and Sep-
tember 2022. The themes were also further discussed 
under supervision for expert supervisory input, review, 
and iterative development (ME, PH, & EC). This process 
supported the quality of the theme generation. After this 
iterative process, four main themes and six sub-themes 
were developed from 126 codes.
Results
Search outcome
A total of 1,597 articles were identified by the initial 
search. After 107 duplicates and 148 unsuitable studies 
were removed, 762 titles and abstracts were screened 
and a further 652 were excluded. The full text of 110 
articles was retrieved and screened by the first author 
for eligibility and 99 articles did not meet the inclu-
sion criteria. After reviewing the reference lists of 
the remaining studies, two additional studies that 
met the inclusion criteria were identified. One final 
study was found while writing the first draft that met 
the inclusion criteria. Thus, a total of 14 qualitative 
studies were reviewed with the research teams, who 
decided to include all 14 in this systematic review. The 
PRISMA Flow Diagram shows a detailed description of 
the study selection process (Fig. 1).
Results of the thematic synthesis
The four main themes (see Fig.  2) generated through 
the thematic synthesis are “a variety of emotional sup-
port”
, “tangible and intangible instrumental support”
, 
“traditional rituals and spiritual support”
, and “the all-
encompassing natal home”
. Each of the main themes and 
sub-themes is discussed below in more detail.
A variety of emotional support
This main theme describes women’s experiences of emo-
tional support during pregnancy. The data from the 
included papers illustrated that the participants expe-
rienced increased emotional support during pregnancy 
from their female networks and marital relationships [10, 
36, 38, 40, 42–48]. For some, the experience of emotional 
support existed across a variety, including some women 
who reported dissatisfaction.
Female network connections  This sub-theme offers 
insight into a range of sources from which the women 
had previously gained emotional support during preg-
nancy. The participants highlighted that they gained 
emotional support through their connections with other 
females within their social networks [10, 36, 38–40, 46]. 
Female emotional support could be afforded by family 
members (e.g., mothers, grandmothers, sisters, or sisters-
in-law) or other female friends and neighbours. Pregnant 
women described emotional support as the act of women 
expressing care, sharing, and expressing feelings and sup-
portive words, and listening to them. Some women also 
referenced how their mothers offered emotional support 
during the perinatal period and how they perceived this 
support as essential throughout their pregnancy.
“There are enough people around me to talk to and 
support, (but) mainly I would tell my mother about 
everything. She has been very supportive through-
out” [46].
“Sister-in-law told me: ‘Do not get afraid, nothing 
will happen,
’ when I felt the pain, she told me, ‘Do 
not worry, nothing will happen’” [10].
Moreover, some women mentioned that during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, when social restrictions were in 
Page 11 of 19
Al‑Mutawtah et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:782 
	
place, receiving gifts from loved ones expressed love and 
care between the female relatives and friends and the 
pregnant women.
“Due to social restrictions, Kelly’s mother and sisters 
sent a stroller and a car seat to celebrate her preg-
nancy” [36].

Page 12 of 19
Al‑Mutawtah et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:782 
In addition to receiving gifts during Covid-19, some 
women revealed that connecting via social media with 
both pregnant and non-pregnant friends helped them to 
alleviate their stress and ensured that they were not alone 
during this challenging time.
“Cause like my husband was great support too, but 
to communicate with someone who is more in your 
shoes is helpful” [36].
The above shows how the women’s connections with 
others offered a variety of emotional support both before 
and during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Care and affection from the husband/ partner  This 
sub-theme outlines a range of emotional support that 
the women experienced from their husband or partner 
during pregnancy. This was sometimes described as how 
their husband’s paid attention to them, encouraged them 
with supportive words, and allowed them space to dis-
cuss their concerns of the pregnancy [36, 37, 40–42, 44, 
45, 47].
“I feel lucky that I have somebody that’s willing to let 
me go take a bath and not be consumed in playing a 
video game or something. He was always listening to 
what I needed” [41].
In addition, this shows that some husbands met wom-
en’s needs when they were patient during pregnancy, 
avoiding any conflict or arguments [43]. Meanwhile, 
husbands prevented their pregnant wives from having 
to do hard manual labour, such as working in a factory, 
as an expression of affection and care [45]. Care can 
also be exemplified through the husband taking care of 
their wives’ diets.
“My husband is so loving and caring; he takes care 
for my diet, he brings me ½ kg milk and fruits on 
daily basis” [44].
Dissatisfaction with relationships  This sub-theme gives 
insights into the other end of the spectrum, showing 
how some women experienced a lack of emotional sup-
port during pregnancy (highlighted in 6 of the 14 studies 
included) [38–40, 44, 47, 48]. For example, some women 
discussed how their husbands or partners were less car-
ing and did not focus on their health or the health of 
their babies. There was also dissatisfaction when their 
husbands did not understand any emotional changes that 
they may have experienced.
“My husband does not ask me what the doctor said 
about me and baby’s condition; when I come back 
from the doctor’s clinic, he is careless” [44].
Furthermore, women without close family and 
friends or who live far from them described themselves 
as lonely or helpless [38, 39, 44, 47].
“I know almost no one here. I met a woman, but 
she moved, and now there’s no one” [38].

Tangible and intangible instrumental support
This main theme illustrates a range of instrumental social 
support that the women experienced during pregnancy. 
As part of this theme, tangible support refers to material 
aids, e.g., the provision of money or goods and behav-
ioural acts, such as helping with household chores [18, 
66]. Alternatively, intangible support describes directive 
guidance, such as information, advice, constructive feed-
back, and affirmation about the women’s health during 
pregnancy [67]. The first and second subthemes, “finan-
cial support from the husband and family” and “practi-
cal support from family and friends” relate to tangible 
support, and the third, “health information support”
, to 
intangible support.
Financial support from the husband and family  This 
sub-theme describes how some of the participants 
appeared to be satisfied with their financial situation and 
the financial support they received from their husbands 
or families. However, this was not true of all women; 
some were dissatisfied with the financial support avail-
able to them. The source of financial support varied but 
included the participants’ husbands and parents and 
grandparents [10, 37, 40, 42, 44, 48]. One of the partici-
pants expressed how her husband’s financial support 
uplifts her mood.
“I want him to buy baby items for the baby or he 
gives me money to buy. This makes me feel good 
because it shows that he is concerned about my situ-
ation” [37].
Practical support from family and friends  For this sub-
theme, the women’s husbands and in-laws were referred 
to as sources of practical help. Some women also men-
tioned their mothers and friends, although the partici-
pants rarely asked them for practical support [10, 36–39, 
43–46]. Forms of practical support included helping with 
household chores, cooking, childcare, shopping, and tak-
ing the pregnant person to their antenatal appointments. 
Women perceived their husbands as providers of many 
aspects of practical support during pregnancy, particu-
larly assisting with daily housework, taking them to natal 
clinics, and providing childcare for their children [10, 37, 
45, 46]. These tasks were also mentioned in connection 
to other family members, such as the women’s mothers, 
and friends.
“My husband used to help me with things I could not 
do. For example, carrying water for cows” [10].
“When I was vomiting for the first few months, three 
different friends used to cook different dishes for me 
every day; they looked after me so well” [46].
Furthermore, some participants highlighted how their 
family and friends provided practical support during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. They talked about how their loved 
ones helped them with grocery shop and run errands.
“They’ll call and be like, ‘Do you need me to get you 
anything? I’m at the store, that way you don’t have 
to go out” [36].
Health information support  This sub-theme provides 
insight into how healthcare professionals were consid-
ered sources of information and advice, in addition to 
people such as mothers, friends, and pregnancy group 
members. This included positive feedback to normalise 
the pregnant person’s experience, information about the 
foetus’s health condition, nutrition advice and informa-
tion about delivery [10, 36, 38–40, 45, 46, 48].
Some participants never mentioned healthcare provid-
ers as routine sources of information support but occa-
sionally referred to them when describing acute problems 
related to pregnancy, the health of the foetus, or delivery 
information [40, 45, 46]. Other women, especially moth-
ers, were routine sources of information and advice.
“My mother had 11 children, out of which seven 
survive… therefore she gave all advice (during preg-
nancy). And I followed her advice” [46].
During the Covid-19 pandemic, some pregnant women 
faced a lack of informational support from healthcare 
providers about the Covid-19 virus and lockdown regula-
tions. This led them to rely upon their pregnancy group 
peers to discuss concerns online through social media. 
For example, Charvat et al. [36] referred to the following 
quotes by two participants:
“They don’t really tell me [anything]. And [my obste-
trician] makes me feel comfortable as he tells me not 
to worry. He says I’m not high-risk, etc. But no, my 
OB doesn’t talk much about the actual virus.
”
These examples give an overview of the different forms 
and sources of health information support in the context 
of the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.
Traditional rituals and spiritual support
This main theme refers to any culturally specific support 
(i.e., to avoid certain types of foods or exercises and to go 
out at noon) or any cultural or traditional practices dur-
ing pregnancy that centre the well-being of the mother 
and child [10, 36, 38, 40, 45, 48]. The examples presented 
below will demonstrate how the women reported vari-
ous forms of such support, including advice on move-
ment and exercise, traditional foods, and avoiding evil 
Page 14 of 19
Al‑Mutawtah et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:782 
spirits [10, 38]. These forms of support usually came 
from grandmothers, mothers, sisters-in-law, and aunts, 
as some participants mentioned in Edmonds’s et al. [10] 
study:
“You cannot go out at noon, evening, dawn, and 
night. Evil spirits will catch you.
”
“She (sister-in-law) forbade me to move in a clumsy 
way. She told me to be careful about movement and 
timing of movement.
”
Spiritual support, in the context of this review, refers 
to relying on the ‘higher spiritual being’ (as some partici-
pants called it God and others called it Allah) to protect 
and reduce stress and pain during pregnancy via prayers 
from the pregnant women and their husbands, moth-
ers, and grandmothers. The concept of spiritual support 
signifies the religious dimension of a relationship with a 
preferred power (e.g., God, Allah, or Brahman) [48]. All 
pregnant women in the selected studies highlighted God 
as a form of spiritual support, mentioning trusting God, 
praying to God to reduce stress, and faith in God’s pro-
tection [10, 36, 38, 40, 45, 48].
“Prayer and supplication to God help me calm down 
and reduce my stress” [48].
Spiritual support was not only experienced by the 
pregnant women but was a shared relational experience 
among them, their husbands, and other close family 
members. During the Covid-19 pandemic, faith in God 
was a type of support that one participant mentioned.
“When asked how she feels about the information 
she has received from her doctors, Becka said, ‘Con-
fused. Nothing set in stone… Yeah, the information 
I get is all over the place. And so, I mean, the best I 
can do is keep myself protected and hope to God that 
it keeps me protected’” [36].
Moreover, some participants reported religious group 
support during their pregnancy, mainly through counsel-
ling and financial support. The religious group support 
gave these women a sense of security and gave them the 
strength to persevere through this difficult time. It also 
gave them a sense of purpose, knowing that they had a 
support system, and that God was in control.
The all‑encompassing parental home
The final main theme refers to how the participants 
expressed their experiences of social support within their 
family homes. For example, the parental home is the 
home of the pregnant woman’s parents, which usually, 
as the participants revealed, was the setting in which all 
their needs were met during pregnancy. This theme was 
developed from three studies assessing social support 
in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh [10, 44, 46]. Most of 
the women from these countries mentioned their paren-
tal home as an integral part of their lives and described 
their parental home as a place where they feel happy and 
relaxed and receive more care.
“My parents thought if I will be there [in-laws’ 
house], I will have to work, so I won’t be able to take 
rest also, that is why they [my parents] brought me 
here” [46].
The review affirmed that during pregnancy, women 
tend to spend more time in their parental homes, as their 
families often look after them in terms of chores, cook-
ing, and cleaning [10].
Discussion
This review sought to analyse and synthesise all avail-
able qualitative evidence about women’s experiences of 
social support during pregnancy. The participants in 
the included studies described a broad variety of social 
support experiences, including emotional, instrumen-
tal, and informational support. Four main themes were 
generated: “a variety of emotional support”
, “tangible and 
intangible instrumental support”
, “traditional rituals and 
spiritual support”
, and “the all-encompassing parental 
home”
.
This review found that pregnant people received emo-
tional support from a diverse range of people within their 
social networks, gaining helpful support in terms of cop-
ing mechanisms and the regulation of stress during preg-
nancy and the COVID pandemic [10, 36, 42, 43, 45, 46]. 
These findings align with Rini et al. [23], who found that 
emotional and intimate support from the marital rela-
tionship and the husband supports adjustment during 
pregnancy and increases well-being. Kolker et  al. [68] 
also found that emotional support was particularly criti-
cal during the pandemic, as many women experienced 
isolation and loneliness. The lack of physical connec-
tion with family and friends due to the pandemic caused 
many women to experience higher levels of stress, anxi-
ety, and feelings of loneliness. Women’s emotions are 
regulated through social support and their relationships, 
which, in turn, may reduce emotional exhaustion during 
pregnancy due to the fear of childbirth or fears of hav-
ing a child born with illness [69, 70]. The importance of 
emotional support (e.g., listening and affectionate inter-
actions) is evident and consistent with the findings of this 
review [10, 36, 41].
Conversely, this review also highlighted a lack of or 
dissatisfaction with the emotional support that some of 
the participants experienced [38–40, 44, 47, 48]. Insuf-
ficient family support harmed pregnant women’s mater-
nal behaviour and health. For example, Fernandez and 
Page 15 of 19
Al‑Mutawtah et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:782 
	
Newby [71] used interviews to explore the extent to 
which pregnant women of Mexican descent in the United 
States were supported by their families and partners. 
Their results indicated an association between family 
support and the circumstances of the pregnancy. Women 
without cohabiting relationships with the baby’s father 
before becoming pregnant received less emotional sup-
port from their families, particularly their mothers. These 
women were, therefore, less likely to look forward to pre-
natal care, adopt a healthy behaviour (e.g., smoking), or 
be excited about giving birth to their babies.
This finding also highlights the importance of instru-
mental support, such as financial, informational, and 
practical support during pregnancy. As it revealed that a 
lack of financial support increased stress and dissatisfac-
tion, while the provision of this support increased feel-
ings of safety, emotional support, and being cared for 
and not alone [10, 40, 42, 44, 48]. Therefore, although 
instrumental (e.g., financial, or informational) support 
may be seen as merely practical support, these types of 
behaviours may make the woman feel that she is loved, 
cared for, and supported: that she matters [37]. Thus, the 
practical aspects of social support may not be considered 
separate categories of support but occasionally interact-
ing forms of social support.
Dissatisfaction with the husband’s or partner’s practical 
support also was found as part of the thematic synthesis 
[43, 44]. However, when considering the role of practical 
support, a gap in the literature appears regarding many 
cultural factors. For instance, many studies argue that 
culture should be considered when trying to understand 
perceived satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the sup-
port given [72–74]. For example, in Western cultures, 
fathers’ roles have evolved from being only breadwinners 
to partners who play an active role in all aspects of their 
children’s lives [41]. However, women in Middle Eastern 
cultures (Saudi Arabia and Iran) are assumed to be pri-
marily responsible for traditionally feminine tasks and 
homemaking, including attending to children’s needs, 
cleaning, and cooking, whereas men are the key bread-
winners and are responsible for traditionally masculine 
tasks, such as making money, and home repairs [75, 
76]. This is an important argument as cross-cultural dif-
ferences or the impact of culture on pregnant women’s 
perceptions were not considered in most of the studies 
included in this review, which might be one of its critical 
limitations.
The included studies highlighted how important infor-
mational support was for women to understand or make 
sense of their health-related experiences and gather 
information during pregnancy. This included positive 
feedback to normalise their experience, information 
about the foetus’s health condition and nutrition advice. 
Gist-Mackey et al. [77] suggested that informational sup-
port has previously been determined vital during times of 
uncertainty and stress (such as pregnancy and COVID-
19 pandemic), supporting other literature affirming that 
informational support can decrease stress, anxiety, and 
ambiguity among pregnant women [78, 79].
The theme of traditional rituals and spiritual support 
was also generated as part of the thematic synthesis. This 
was considered to take several different forms, such as 
prayers and advice on traditional food and avoiding evil 
spirits [10, 36, 38, 40, 45, 48]. The role of traditional cul-
tural customs, values, and beliefs has been explored in 
the existing literature. For instance, Ayaz and Efe [80] 
described how some people in Turkey believe that, if the 
pregnant woman eats quince during pregnancy, the baby 
will be born with dimples. However, the overall results 
of this review indicated that some pregnant women per-
ceived traditional rituals as a way to show concern and 
care [10, 36, 38]. Prayer was a form of spiritual support 
that the participants in the included studies relied on 
during pregnancy to reduce stress and seek protection 
[10, 36, 38, 45]. However, the role of spirituality and vary-
ing spiritual beliefs regarding the experience of stress 
may also be culturally influenced and shaped. In the 
current literature, the stress-buffering impact of spiritu-
ality may be higher among people from more conserva-
tive, religious cultures (e.g., Iranians), compared with 
those who are less religious, less conservative cultures. 
For example, a study conducted in Iran found that spir-
ituality can reduce stress, particularly stress related to 
pregnancy [81]. It is also important to acknowledge that 
the role of spiritual support may have not only positive 
effects; as Mann et  al. [82] emphasise, spirituality was 
associated with increased perceived stress among preg-
nant Hispanic people living in the US. The most likely 
explanation lies in the phenomenon of reverse causation 
(women with higher levels of stress seek comfort in reli-
gion). Therefore, the impact of spirituality on perceived 
stress may also be affected by the culture, among other 
broad factors (i.e., social, cognitive, personal, emotional, 
situational, or demographic factors).
During pregnancy, the parental home appeared impor-
tant, with visits to this home described as motivated by 
the desire to reduce the pregnant person’s workload [10, 
44, 46]. The benefits of visiting the parental home were 
often related to the women being surrounded by their 
families, who offered social and practical support. The 
finding that pregnant women experienced yearning for 
their parental homes can be explained by the theory of 
the collectivism/ individualism dichotomy as this theme 
arose from three studies performed in collectivist cul-
tures (India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan). The theory of 
the collectivism/individualism dichotomy argues that 
Page 16 of 19
Al‑Mutawtah et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2023) 23:782 
individualistic cultures prioritise the needs of individuals 
over the needs of the group as a whole. Collectivist cul-
tures are characterised by strong emotional bonds and 
social relationships between society members, especially 
mothers, whereas individualistic cultures have weaker 
emotional bonds [76, 83]. Individuals from more col-
lectivistic backgrounds reported feeling less alone and 
experiencing more social support from their families 
than those from individualistic backgrounds [84, 85]. 
Therefore, further studies on individualistic cultures 
are needed to confirm these findings. However, they are 
consistent, from a broad psychological perspective, with 
the stress-buffering model, which emphasises that social 
support may buffer stress and contribute to a sense of 
belonging and stability, resulting in improved self-esteem 
and reduced stress [28, 86–88].
Strengths and limitations
This review is the first one to consider qualitative 
research on women’s experiences of social support 
during pregnancy, which may inform future research 
designs. Additionally, it examines women’s experiences of 
social support from all over the world and takes a rigor-
ous and systematic approach. It reveals how social sup-
port and other factors impact women’s well-being during 
pregnancy and what types of support they value. This 
review also provides insight into pregnant experiences 
during COVID-19 and provides some preliminary find-
ings derived from recent research. However, the failure 
to conduct a sufficiently exhaustive search for studies is 
a potential limitation of any review, including this one 
[89]. Also, the small number of studies in this review 
curtail the richness and depth of the analysis of indi-
vidual subjective meanings, making the findings difficult 
to generalise. Although the generalisation of qualitative 
findings is not typically the aim of qualitative research, 
generalisation does allow the analysis to be transferred to 
other contexts and settings [33]. Moreover, most of the 
included papers were from low-income countries; thus, 
future studies are needed to examine women’s experi-
ences in wealthy countries.
Implications
Healthcare providers (e.g., nurses, psychologists, or 
social workers) should raise awareness about the impor-
tance of providing pregnant women with the required 
social support (e.g., emotional, instrumental, and infor-
mational) through their social circles, including the hus-
band, mother, father, and female networks. Healthcare 
providers should tailor social support interventions to 
meet individualised needs as women’s needs may differ. 
For example, Dennis et al. [90] found that women who 
participated in breastfeeding peer support interventions 
valued emotional support most and were less focused 
on education and informational support, although many 
social support interventions focus on informational and 
educational aspects [91]. Interventions are most effective 
when they are developed based on the needs of the tar-
get population [92]. It is therefore important for health-
care providers to not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, 
but rather tailor their services and interventions in order 
to meet the specific and diverse needs of women within 
their communities, based on research and data analysis 
results. Moreover, healthcare providers need to screen 
pregnant women to know what they value in receiving 
support and assess their level of emotional and practi-
cal support during pregnancy. This screening should be 
followed by encouraging the inclusion of the key support 
people (friends, family members, and partners) through-
out pregnancy [43, 47]. Yawn et al. [93] concluded that 
654 of 1,897 women had elevated screening scores indic-
ative of depression. This is significant as it shows that 
many women needed additional help and resources for 
mental health issues. Mental health screenings can pro-
vide valuable information to help identify those need-
ing extra support. Thus, by integrating formal mental 
health screening into a wider assessment and taking into 
account the factors highlighted in this study, health pro-
fessionals could achieve a more person-centred, holistic, 
and effective provision.
Additionally, policymakers and other relevant stake-
holders should consider a community-based social sup-
port program for pregnant women as a means of helping 
them cope with the challenges of pregnancy. By provid-
ing such programs, we can facilitate a more compre-
hensive approach to maternal care, acknowledging that 
emotional and social support is an essential component 
of the well-being of a pregnant woman.
Conclusions
This systematic review provides insight into women’s 
experiences of social support during pregnancy. The 
results indicate that pregnant women experienced and 
valued a wide variety of emotional support from different 
sources, including their female networks, husbands, fam-
ilies, and parents. Furthermore, women experienced a 
mixture of tangible and intangible support and reported 
satisfaction and dissatisfaction with these kinds of sup-
port. In addition, the review highlighted the role of spirit-
uality and how this was sometimes perceived as reducing 
stress and offering a coping mechanism, whilst for oth-
ers, spirituality increased the stress experience. Overall, 
the results of this review provide insight into a range of 
experiences associated with social support in pregnancy.
