Abstract In the context of climate change , water availability has emerged as a pressing concern in agriculture , indicating the urgency to enhance irrigation management . Nevertheless, accurately quantifying irrigation schedules in diverse climates and soil textures remains a complex challenge. Here, a three-year irrigation experiment (2020–2022) of greenhouse tomato was conducted at three typical locations (Yulin, Yangling and Hanzhong) in northwest China. The irrigation schedules were determined by the cumulative evaporation (CE) measured from a 20 cm pan. A total nine treatments were set by combining three irrigation frequencies (IF) with three single doses (ID). Twenty indices related to tomato growth, photosynthesis , yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefit were evaluated comprehensively by using TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) and GRA (grey relational analysis) methods of combining weights based on game theory . The results showed that the indicator with highest weight was yield, followed by crop water productivity and vitamin C. The optimal ranges of irrigation frequency (irrigation dose) were determined as follows: 10.00–11.08 mm (0.81–0.90 CE) in Yulin, 13.12–15.68 mm (0.77–0.89 CE) in Yangling, and 11.44–16.40 mm (0.67–0.77 CE) in Hanzhong, respectively. This study introduces a method applied to prioritize the key indicators for irrigation scheduling, providing a reference for optimizing irrigation practices in greenhouse tomato production and improving water management in agriculture.

Introduction Irrigation is crucial to sustainable agricultural development and food security in arid and semi-arid regions. Drip irrigation , recognized as a water-saving technology at the field scale, is extensively employed in greenhouse production ( Van der Kooij et al., 2013 ). It is common for growers to determine irrigation events empirically based on personal experience and the weather forecast , which aggravates the waste of water resources , reduces production profit, and hinders the sustainability of the environment ( Exner et al., 2014 ). Moreover, the expansion of irrigated areas and irrational use of water resources in these areas have led to severe water scarcity issues ( Zhang et al., 2021a ), highlighting the urgency of optimizing irrigation management . Irrigation frequency (IF) and irrigation dose (ID) directly determine the soil water distribution ( Kisi et al., 2021 ), thus affecting root development and plant growth. Excessive irrigation can lead to a decline of crop nutrition quality (e.g., sugar, protein, and vitamin C) and environmental issues (e.g., soil salinization and groundwater pollution) ( Chen et al., 2014 , Exner et al., 2014 ). Appropriate irrigation frequency can promote nutritional quality ( Du et al., 2017 ), yet the impact on yield remains unclear and varies with species and regions ( Kumar et al., 2022 ). The design of IF and ID, that is, when and how much water to irrigate, should be quantified to balance the benefits of irrigation on crop yield and fruit quality with environmental concerns. Accurately assessing the specific environmental conditions and soil characteristics of a particular area is crucial for determining the ideal irrigation schedules that promote optimal plant growth and efficient water use ( McCarthy et al., 2023 ). The reference crop evapotranspiration (ET 0 ) is mainly determined by environmental factors, such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and solar radiation (Rn). The distribution of soil water varies across different soil textures following irrigation events, resulting in distinct wetting patterns ( Karimi et al., 2020 ). Sandy soils may benefit from more frequent but smaller doses than loamy soils ( Saha et al., 2020 , Zhang et al., 2023 ). However, challenges remain in precisely quantifying irrigation frequency and dose to adapt to different climates and soil textures. A common method for estimating crop ET 0 is using evaporation from a 20 cm pan as a proxy; this method can be used to guide irrigation practices in greenhouses ( He et al., 2021 ). Mathematical approaches that evaluate the growth of crops have been widely used to optimize water-saving irrigation schemes ( Liu et al., 2021 ), such as analytic hierarchy process, entropy method, game theory , and principal component analysis ( Qu et al., 2022 , Yu et al., 2023 ). To address these limitations of single evaluation method, a scientific comprehensive evaluation approach that integrates both objective and subjective approaches, was proposed to increase the robustness and universality of results ( Yang et al., 2023 ). The comprehensive evaluation was achieved through various methods, such as the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the gray relational analysis method (GRA), which have been acknowledged as efficient tool to optimize irrigation schedules ( Qu et al., 2022 , Wang et al., 2023 ). Greenhouse tomatoes are a major horticultural commodity worldwide. The complex climate and diverse soil textures in Northwest China pose great challenges in making efficient irrigation schedules of greenhouse tomatoes under water shortages ( Qiu et al., 2013 , Zheng et al., 2013 ). We conducted a three-year irrigation trial for greenhouse tomatoes in three typical regions of Shaanxi Province, representing the majority of soil textures and climates in Northwest China ( Fig. S1 and Table S1 ). We aimed to: (ⅰ) develop a comprehensive evaluation system to assess the impact of different irrigation schedules on tomato growth, photosynthesis , yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefit; (ⅱ) quantify the effects of irrigation frequency and dose on comprehensive evaluation results; and (ⅲ) determine the optimal irrigation schedules for greenhouse tomatoes under different soil textures. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental sites The trials were conducted at three locations in Shaanxi Province, Northwest China ( Fig. S1 ): the Academy of Agricultural Sciences experimental station (38.24°N, 109.77°E) in Yulin (denoted YL); the Northwest A&F University experimental station (34.26°N, 108.04°E) in Yangling (denoted LY); and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences experimental station (33.08°N, 107.04°E) in Hanzhong (denoted HZ). The greenhouses at each site were the same size: 85 m (length) × 17 m (width) × and 4 m (height). Based on the FAO classification system ( FAO, 1990 ), the soils in three test greenhouses were classified as sandy loam , loam , and silty clay , respectively. The physicochemical characteristics of the three soil textures at 0–60 cm depth are shown in Table 1 . Soil particle sizes were measured with a particle size analyzer, Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, England). The soil hydraulic properties , including soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity curve ( Fig. S2 ), were determined using pressure plate method ( Ankeny, 1992 ) and RETC software ( Van Genuchten et al., 1991 ). The daily solar radiation (Rn) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) inside the greenhouse were collected and calculated by using a standard automatic weather logger (HOBO Event Data Logger, Onset Computer Corp., USA) located in the middle of each greenhouse.

Experimental design Tomato seedlings ( Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Jinpeng) were transplanted into a greenhouse when they reached the fifth-leaf stage. To ensure plant survival, all plots were immediately supplemented with 20 mm of water. The planting pattern in each plot consisted of two rows of tomatoes with two drip lines ( Fig. 2 a). Each plot measured 6 m × 1.2 m and accommodated 40 seedlings planted with 50 cm row spacing . The drippers were positioned 30 cm apart along each drip line to align with the position of each plant, and each dripper had a discharge rate of 1.8 L h −1 . A water meter was installed in each plot to record the amount of supplied water accurately. 45 t/ha of well-rotted organic manure (sheep manure) were applied as base fertilizer before transplanting . 350 kg/ha of compound fertilizer (19% N, 19% P 2 O 5 , 19% K 2 O) were evenly divided into four parts and applied during the first, second, third, and fourth ear fruit began to expand.

(c) The layout of experimental plots. Irrigation trials were conducted simultaneously from August to December in 2020, 2021, and 2022 at three sites involving three levels of irrigation frequency and dose ( Fig. 2 b). Irrigation was triggered by cumulative evaporation (CE) from a 20 cm pan—not a standard pan worldwide, but commonly used in China for estimating ET 0 . The pan, with a diameter of 20 cm and a depth of 11 cm, was positioned 20 cm above the plant canopy. Evaporation measurement was conducted daily at 08:00 a.m. using a specifically calibrated glass-graduated flask ( Liu et al., 2019 ). The plants were irrigated at 08:10 a.m. when the CE reached specific thresholds, namely 20±2 mm for the low frequency (IF 1 ), 15±2 mm for the medium frequency (IF 2 ), and 10±2 mm for the high frequency (IF 3 ). Three irrigation doses were set: low (ID 0.5 =0.5 CE), medium (ID 0.7 =0.7 CE), and high (ID 0.9 =0.9 CE). Each irrigation frequency was combined with three different irrigation doses, resulting in nine treatments. Each treatment was randomly assigned three replicates ( Fig. 2 c). To prevent water disturbance between the plots, a plastic film was used to separate the plots to a depth of 60 cm. Considering the specific water demand patterns of tomatoes during different growth stages, it is recommended to adjust the irrigation amount at different growth stages by multiplying a coefficient ( Allen et al., 1998 ). The coefficient values for the initial, middle, and late stages were quantified as 0.6, 1.15, and 0.8, respectively. The irrigation events, including irrigation times, irrigation intervals, and cumulative irrigation amount, are illustrated in Fig. 3 .

Growth data Four plants were randomly sampled from each plot to measure the plant height (PHT, cm) and total dry matter accumulation (TDW, g/plant) at the end of trial. The total dry matter accumulation and root/shoot ratio (R/S, %) was calculated as follows: (1) Total dry matter accumulation = Weight root + Weight stem + Weight leaf + Weight fruit (2) Root / shoot ratio = Weight root / ( Weight stem + Weight leaf + Weight fruit ) × 100 Four plants were selected from each plot and the leaf area was measured using a Li-3000 leaf area meter (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The leaf area index (LAI, m 2 /m 2 ) was then computed as follows: (3) LAI = The total leaf area per plant / The occupied land area per plant 2.3.2. Photosynthetic indices The photosynthetic indices, including net photosynthesis rate (P n ), transpiration rate (T r ), stomatal conductance (G s ), and intercellular CO 2 concentration (C i ), serve as key parameters in evaluating tomato physiological responses . On a sunny day during the tomato fruiting period, measurements of these four parameters were taken from the latest fully expanded leaf between 9:00 am and 11:00 am, using a portable photosynthetic system (Li-6800, Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The light intensity was set at 1000 μmol/m 2 /s with a ratio of 90% red to 10% blue light, and the CO 2 concentration in the leaf chamber was maintained at 400 μmol/mol. The relative humidity in the leaf chamber was kept at 70%, the temperature was set to 28 ℃ and the flow rate was set to 500 μmol/s. Three plants were selected from each plot and recordings were taken once the leaf reached steady state in leaf chamber. 2.3.3. Yield and water use Ten plants were randomly selected in the center of each plot to determine the tomato marketable yield per hectare (t/ha) and single fruit weight (SFW, g). Crop water productivity (WP, kg/m 3 ) was calculated as follows ( Fernández et al., 2020 ): (4) WP = yield / ET × 100 where ET is the total evapotranspiration (mm), which was calculated using the following soil water balance equation: (5) ET = P + W I + U − R − D W ± ∆ S where P is the effective precipitation (mm); W I is the irrigation amount (mm); U is the groundwater recharge (mm); R is surface runoff (mm); D W is (mm) deep drainage; ∆ S is the change in 0–60 cm soil water storage from the beginning to the end of the trial (mm). Because experiments were conducted in greenhouse, P was ignored; Here, the groundwater table was far below plant root zone , so U was assumed to be zero; R was considered to be ignored as the terrain is flat; below 60 cm, the soil water content (SWC) remained consistently stable before and after irrigation cycle, with SWC values at 60 cm depth in Yulin, Yangling, and Hanzhong holding steady at 0.1264, 0.1627, and 0.2213 cm³ cm - ³, respectively. Thus, the above equation can be simplified as follows: (6) ET = W i ± ∆ S 2.3.4. Fruit quality The third ear of matured fruit from four plants in each plot was sampled to measure the fruit quality of tomato. Fruit firmness (FF, kg/m 2 ) was measured at the equatorial location with a hardometer (GY-3 Top, Hangzhou, China). Soluble sugar content (SSC, mg/g) was measured using the anthrone method ( Liu et al., 2013 ). Soluble protein content (SPC, mg/g) was measured using Coomassie Brilliant Blue method ( Akubor and Ogbadu, 2003 ). Vitamin C (VC, mg/kg) was calculated by the standard titration method with the 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenols sodium salt solution ( Stevens et al., 2006 ). Lycopene content (LC, mg/100 g) was extracted by organic solvent extraction ( Dannehl et al., 2014 ). Fruit total soluble solids (TSS, %) was measured with a handheld saccharometer (ATAGO, PR-32, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). 2.3.5. Nutrients residue in the soil after harvest After the tomatoes were harvested, soil samples were collected from the 0–20, 20–40, and 40–60 cm soil layers using a soil auger. Samples were collected along the profile, starting at the midpoint of two drippers in a drip belt. Soil NO 3 - -N (SAN) and available P (SAP) were tested with AA3 continuous flow Analyzer (Auto Analyzer-III, German Bran). An atomic absorption spectrometer (Hitachi Z-2000, Tokyo, Japan) was used for testing soil available K (SAK). The calculation of soil NO 3 - -N (or available P or available K) was as follows ( Lu et al., 2019 ): (7) S = C × H × BD 10 where S denotes the soil NO 3 - -N (or available P or available K) accumulation (kg/ha), C represents the soil NO 3 - -N (or available P or available K) content (mg/kg), H is the soil layer thickness (cm), and BD is the soil bulk density (g/cm 3 ). 2.4.

The subfactors are as follows: u 11 is plant height, u 12 is total dry matter accumulation, u 13 is leaf area index, u 14 is root/shoot ratio; u 21 is net photosynthesis rate, u 22 is transpiration rate, u 23 is stomatal conductance, u 24 is intercellular CO 2 concentration; u 31 is single fruit weight, u 32 is yield per hectare, u 33 is crop water productivity; u 41 is fruit firmness, u 42 is soluble sugar content, u 43 is soluble protein content, u 44 is vitamin C, u 45 is lycopene content, u 46 is total soluble solids; u 51 is accumulation of soil NO 3 - -N, u 52 is soil available P, u 53 is soil available K.

(16) W i = M i n ∑ 1 n M i n IV. The calculation of subjective weights ( W AHP ). (17) W AHP = W 1 , W 2 , … , W n T V. The consistency ratio index (CR) was calculated to ensure the reliability of the weights: (18) CR = CI / RI (19) CI = λ max − n n − 1 (20) λ max = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n θ W AHP i W i where CI represents the consistency index, λ max is maximum eigenvalue of the judgment matrix, which was calculated to determine CI. RI denotes the average random consistency value, which is determined by n and can be obtained from Table S3 . When CR was less than 0.10, the matrix had good consistency. (2) Identification of the objective weight via the entropy method (EM). (I) Construction of the original evaluation parameter matrix X. (21) X = x ij n × m = x 11 x 12 ⋯ x 1 m x 21 x 22 ⋯ x 2 m ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ x n 1 x n 2 ⋯ x nm where x ij ( i = 1, 2, ⋯ , n and j = 1, 2, ⋯ , m) represents the value of jth subfactor in the i th treatment. Here, n = 9, m=20. (II) The standardization of the data. For the positive indices, the formula is given as follows: (22) y ij = x ij − min x 1 j , x 2 j , . , x nj max x 1 j , x 2 j , . , x nj − min x 1 j , x 2 j , . , x nj For the negative indices, the formula is given as follows: (23) y ij = max x 1 j , x 2 j , . , x nj − x ij max x 1 j , x 2 j , . , x nj − min x 1 j , x 2 j , . , x nj where y ij denotes the standardized value. Among the subfactors, the positive indices (j=1–17) denote the-greater-the-better attributes (i.e., u 11 − u 46 ), while the negative indices (j=18–20) are the-small-the-better indicators (i.e., u 51 − u 53 ). (III) The probability of each indicator can be calculated as follows: (24) p ij = y ij ∑ i = 1 n y ij (IV) The information entropy was then calculated. Particularly, the j-th index information entropy ( e j ) was defined as: (25) e j = − 1 ln n ∑ i = 1 n p ij ln p ij In Eq. (25) , 0 ≤ e j ≤ 1 . It is assumed that when p ij = 0 is used, p ij ln ( p ij ) = 0 . (V) The calculation of entropy weight ( W EM ).

(I) A new weight set γ was established based on the two weights assigned by the AHP and EM method, using the following procedure: (27) w k = w k 1 , w k 2 , … , w km , m = 20 , k = 1 , 2 (28) γ = ∑ k = 1 2 α k ⋅ w k T , α k > 0 , k = 1 , 2 where w k denote the weights obtained by the AHP ( k = 1 ) and EM ( k = 2 ) method, α k are coefficients ( α 1 + α 2 = 1 )，which were calculated by Eq. (29) . (II) The optimal strategy model was derived based on the centralized model of game theory, using the following approach: (29) m i n = ∑ k = 1 2 α k w k T - w k 2 , ( k = 1 , 2 ) (III) The optimal first derivative conditions of this formula are calculated based on the differential properties of the matrix, as follows: (30) ∑ K = 1 2 α k w k w k T = w k w k T (IV) The optimized set of combined coefficients is { α 1 , α 2 } , which is normalized as follows: (31) α k * = α k ∑ k = 1 2 α k (V) The combined weight γ * is calculated as follows： (32) γ * = ∑ k = 1 2 α k * ⋅ w k T 2.4.3. Comprehensive evaluation (1) Comprehensive evaluation based on TOPSIS. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a decision-making method used to identify the best alternative among a set of feasible solutions. It accomplishes this by comparing each alternative to both a positive ideal solution and a negative ideal solution ( Qu et al., 2022 , Yu et al., 2023 ).

The schemes are sorted according to the relative closeness to form a decision basis. (2) Comprehensive evaluation based on GRA. Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is a methodology within the field of grey system theory that aims to analyze and evaluate the relationships between variables or factors. It provides a useful framework for decision-making, pattern recognition, forecasting, and optimization ( Mu et al., 2022 , Wang et al., 2023 ).

The relationship between comprehensive evaluation value and irrigation frequency, and irrigation dose The quadratic polynomial fitting method was employed to establish a model to quantify the effects of irrigation frequency and dose on greenhouse tomato comprehensive evaluation value: (45) Z = a + b x + cy + d x 2 + e y 2 + f xy where a , b , c , d , e , and f denote equation coefficients; Z represents comprehensive evaluation value; x represents irrigation frequency, which ranged from 10 to 20 mm; y represents irrigation dose, which ranged from 0.5 to 0.9 CE. 2.5. Data analysis Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze the associations between the variables, which were performed using the Origin 2021 (OriginLab Corporation, MA, USA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using the experimental sites (S), year (Y) irrigation frequency (IF) and irrigation dose (ID) as the primary effects and included two-, three- and four-way interactions, which were performed using SPSS software (Version 21.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The subjective weight determined by AHP was calculated by Yaahp software (Shanxi Yuan Juece Software Technology Co., Ltd., China). Statistical analyses and comprehensive evaluation (EM, GT, TOPSIS and GRA) were accomplished with MATLAB 2022 (MathWorks, USA) and Microsoft Excel (Office 2021. Microsoft Corp, USA). 3. Results 3.1. Variation of environmental factors in three test greenhouses The average values of Rn and VPD, as well as PE, exhibited a decreasing trend from Yulin to Yangling and Hanzhong ( Fig. 1 ). Specifically, the average Rn (average VPD, total PE) over three years ranged as follows in Yulin, Yangling, and Hanzhong: 6.16–6.48 MJ/m 2 (0.79–0.85 kPa, 355.0–366.3 mm), 5.11–5.51 MJ/m 2 (0.62–0.70 kPa, 301.5–322.4 mm) and 4.37–4.91 MJ/m 2 (0.50–0.56 kPa, 268.1–285.1 mm), respectively. Yulin, with the highest values of PE, demonstrated the most irrigation times (e.g., 37 times for IF 3 ID 0.5 in 2020) and total irrigation amount (e.g., 340.3 mm for IF 3 ID 0.9 in 2022) ( Fig. 3 ). 3.2. Multifactorial analysis The ANOVAs and correlation analysis among 20 indices was conducted to establish a scientific and reasonable comprehensive evaluation system for greenhouse tomato. Fig. 5 demonstrated that the variables S, IF, ID, as well as their two-way interactions (S × IF, S × ID and IF × ID), and three-way interaction (S × IF × ID), had a significant influence (p < 0.01) on the majority of the indices. Moreover, the results of Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant correlation among many subfactor indicators ( Fig. 6 ). Specifically, the subfactor indicators within the same factor had a significant positive (P < 0.05) correlation with each other, except for the subfactors (e.g., Yield and. WP) within yield and water use. SFW and Yield displayed a significant positive correlation with the subfactors (e.g., PHT and P n ) in growth and photosynthesis, while a negative correlation with the subfactors (e.g., SSC and SAN) in fruit quality and environmental benefit.

Determination of subfactors weights for greenhouse tomato 3.3.1. Subjective weights The consistency ratios ( B r < 0.1 ) obtained from AHP indicated that the results of the consistency test were satisfactory ( Table 3 ). This suggests that the judgment matrix used in the study was scientifically and reasonably established. The weights of factors were decreased with the order: yield and water use > fruit quality >environmental benefit > photosynthesis > growth. The order of subjective weights of subfactors was decreased as follows ( Fig. S3 ): Yield > WP >VC > TSS = SAN > LC > SFW > TDM > P n = G s > LAI = R/S > FF = SSC = SPC > SAK > C i > PHT > T r = SAP. 3.3.2. Objective weights EM was employed to calculate the objective weights of greenhouse tomatoes based on the measured index values at three locations in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The W EM varied between 0.027 and 0.087, showing variations across locations and years ( Fig. S4 ). The indices with the highest weights were predominantly found within the categories of photosynthesis and fruit quality. Conversely, the indices of minimum weight were mainly observed in growth factor, ranging from 0.027 to 0.034. 3.3.3. Combined weights The combined weights of subfactors ranged from 0.004 to 0.225, indicating a significant difference among the 20 indices ( Fig. 7 ). The wide range of weights demonstrated large variation in their relative importance or contribution to the overall evaluation. The indices with higher weights (e.g., closer to 0.225) are likely considered more critical or influential in the analysis, while those with lower weights (e.g., closer to 0.004) have comparatively lesser importance. The weight order of single tomato indicators remains largely consistent across different locations and years, although the specific values may vary. Among the combined weights of different subfactors, the index with the highest weight was yield, followed by WP and VC. On the other hand, the index with the lowest weight was T r or SAP, followed by PHT and C i . Download: Download high-res image (480KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 7 .

Comprehensive evaluation of different treatments Considering the weights of 20 subfactors in the categories of tomato growth, photosynthesis, yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefits, the comprehensive scores for all treatments were calculated using the TOPSIS and GRA methods. Similar ranking trends were observed for both methods ( Table 4 ). The treatments with the highest scores at each location were consistent over time: IF 3 ID 0.9 , IF 2 ID 0.9 , and IF 2 ID 0.7 for Yulin, Yangling, and Hanzhong, respectively. However, the scores (e.g., 0.454 and 0.477 in 2020 and 2021 for IF 1 ID 0.7 ) and rankings (e.g., 6th and 5th in 2020 and 2021 for IF 1 ID 0.7 ) of the same treatment may have slight differences during three years.

Quantification the relationship between comprehensive evaluation results and irrigation frequency, and irrigation dose The regression equations obtained using the TOPSIS and GRA methods are listed in Table 5 . The calculated coefficients of determination (R 2 ) ranged from 0.8031 to 0.9984, and the statistical significance (P) values were less than 0.01. This analysis demonstrated there are statistically significant variations in the comprehensive evaluation results based on the irrigation frequency and irrigation dose. Table 5 .

The optimal irrigation schedules The tomato comprehensive evaluation model exhibited a downward-opening paraboloid ( Fig. 8 , Fig. 9 ), indicating that there is an optimal level of IF and ID that maximizes the comprehensive evaluation value ( Table 5 ). The model obtained from TOPSIS and GRA showed similar trend across the same locations over three years, which provided strong evidence that the comprehensive evaluation system used in the study is robust and scientific. To ensure practical applicability in greenhouse tomato production, the ranges of IF and ID were calculated to encompass more than 95% of the maximum comprehensive evaluation value ( Fig. 10 ). The overlap area revealed the favorable ranges for irrigation frequency and irrigation dose across different locations: Yulin (10 mm < IF < 11.08 mm, 0.81 CE <ID < 0.90 CE), Yangling (13.12 mm < IF < 15.68 mm, 0.77 CE< ID < 0.89 CE), and Hanzhong (11.44 mm < IF < 16.40 mm, 0.67 CE< ID < 0.77 CE), respectively.

Discussion Developing efficient irrigation schedules is necessary to alleviate the water shortage caused by droughts, especially in Northwest of China ( Cheng et al., 2021 , Zheng et al., 2013 ). In the present study, a scientific and reasonable comprehensive evaluation system for the irrigation management of greenhouse tomato was established using 20 indicators. The optimal site-specific irrigation schedules (IF and ID) were determined by considering a wide range of indices and employing reasonable weight assigned (AHP, EM and GT) and appropriate decision-making methods (TOPSIS and GRA). Our findings provided valuable insights in making informed decisions regarding irrigation management under various environmental conditions and soil textures, leading to more efficient water usage and tomato production. 4.1. Determination of the weights of selected indicators The rational selection of indicators contributed to establishing a scientific evaluation system ( Wang and Rangaiah, 2017 ). In this study, a comprehensive set of indicators was chosen based on their relevance to tomato growth, photosynthesis, yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefits ( Fig. 4 ), which covered multiple dimensions and captured key aspects of greenhouse tomato production. Thus, the evaluation was not limited to a single indicator and instead provided a more holistic understanding of the overall performance and sustainability of tomato production ( Han et al., 2023 ). Pearson correlation analysis revealed that each indicator was irreplaceable in reflecting the overall growth of the tomatoes ( Fig. 6 ). This ensured that the evaluation was comprehensive, relevant, and reliable, allowing accurate assessment and informed decision-making in the field ( Wang et al., 2019 ). The weight allocation for indices plays a crucial role in the comprehensive evaluation process, which quantifies its contribution and reflects the significance in the decision-making ( Tian et al., 2019 ). Here, an integration method (AHP, EM, and GT) accounts for both expert judgments and data-driven analyses, thereby capturing the multidimensional characteristics of the evaluation system. In the present study, the index with the highest weights was yield, followed by WP and VC ( Fig. 7 ), reflecting tangible economic benefits in greenhouse tomato production ( Du et al., 2020 ). And a significant positive relationship between comprehensive evaluation value and yield (WP) was observed ( Fig. S5 ). This finding was similar to the result of a study conducted by Hong et al. (2022) , who also examined this correlation and proposed that the optimal irrigation amount for watermelon yield could serve as the recommended irrigation schedules. And the weights of indices through integration method were consistent with the previous studies related to assign tomato indices weight in irrigation management ( He et al., 2021 , Yu et al., 2023 ). Therefore, the weight allocation in this study is rational and scientific, which could be used in subsequent comprehensive analyses and decision making for irrigation optimization in tomato production. 4.2. Comprehensive evaluation of irrigation management Single-evaluation methods have limitations owing to their utilization of varying mechanisms and perspectives for analyzing information ( Cai et al., 2023 ). By incorporating both the TOPSIS and GRA methods, this study provided a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the performance of different treatments, thereby overcoming the limitations of single method. Similar ranking trends using two comprehensive methods were observed in this study ( Table 4 ). This suggested a certain level of agreement between the two evaluation techniques in assessing the performance of the greenhouse tomato production, which enhanced the confidence in the robustness and scientific nature of the comprehensive evaluation system ( Guo et al., 2022 ). These consistent results across these studies reinforce the reliability and validity of the comprehensive evaluation approach using multiple techniques. A regression model was established to analyze the relationship between comprehensive evaluation results, and irrigation frequency and irrigation dose ( Table 5 ). In the present study, it was observed that irrigation dose had significant effect on all indices ( Fig. 5 ), and the treatments with low irrigation amounts (e.g., IF 1 ID 0.5 , IF 2 ID 0.5 , and IF 3 ID 0.5 ) corresponded to lower comprehensive evaluation scores ( Table 4 ). Previous studies have demonstrated that insufficient water supply can trigger water stress, resulting in reduced crop yield and disruptions to vital plant processes, including growth, photosynthesis, nutrient uptake , and overall metabolic activities. Water deficit may decrease the water potential of fruit cells, thereby augmenting their capacity to absorb water and nutrients from the external environment, consequently enhancing the fruit quality such as TSS, VC and SSC ( Mitchell et al., 1991 , Zheng et al., 2013 ). Existing evidence have shown that adjusting irrigation frequency was an effective measure to improve water productivity and reduce nitrogen leaching and environmental risk ( Liu et al., 2019 , Xiao et al., 2021 ). Although the same irrigation amount was applied, the distribution of soil water and nutrient differed depending on irrigation frequency, thus affecting plant growth ( Shiri et al., 2020 , Xiang et al., 2018 ). Treatments with high and medium irrigation frequency ranked higher than that of low irrigation frequency ( Fig. S6 and Table 4 ). This can be attributed to the fact that increased IF maintained a relatively uniform soil water content throughout the tomato growing period, which ensured an adequate water supply in the root zone ( Yi et al., 2022 ). 4.3. Optimization of site-specific irrigation schedules Notably, the optimal irrigation management schedule varied across the different regions ( Fig. 10 ), likely due to the differences in climatic conditions and soil texture ( Ahmadi et al., 2014 ). In the present study, a significant negative (positive) linear relationship was quantified between optimal IF (ID) and Rn, VPD, Sand %, and K s ( Fig. 11 ). This relationship underscored the role of the supply-demand theory within the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), which explained how stomatal conductance trait behavior control the efficiency of water transport to influence irrigation frequency and irrigation dose ( Gu et al., 2021 , Zhang et al., 2021b ). Our results exhibited a significant positive correlation between daily PE and both Rn and VPD ( Fig. S7 ). This aligns with prior researches demonstrating that atmospheric VPD and Rn play pivotal roles in driving plant evapotranspiration ( Ghimire et al., 2022 , Penman, 1948 ). Furthermore, it was observed that the highest total irrigation amount should be applied in Yulin ( Fig. 3 , Fig. 10 ), primarily attributed to its substantial evaporation demand.

The relationship between optimal IF (ID) and Rn (a, e), VPD (b, f), Sand % (c, g), and K s (d, h) based on TOPSIS and GRA methods. Rn is average net radiation; VPD is average vapor pressure deficit; Sand % is fraction of sand; K s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity ; R 2 is determination coefficient; P is statistically significant value. The supply side was regulated by soil water potential , which was affected by soil textures ( Fig. S2 ). The stomata closed when relationship between transpiration rate and leaf water potential became nonlinear as soil dried ( Abdalla et al., 2021 ). It has been reported that a more dramatic decrease in soil − plant hydraulic conductance and earlier onset of nonlinearity occur in sandy soil than in clay soil ( Abdalla et al., 2022 , Cai et al., 2020 ). The above studies suggested that, in the sites with sandy loam soil, a higher total irrigation amount with a more frequent irrigation schedule but a lower irrigation dose is recommended compared to the sites with loam and silty clay ( Fig. 10 ). This was attributed to lower water transport safety, lower soil water availability and higher deep drainage in sandy loam soil ( Zhang et al., 2023 ), which provided a robust explanation for the comprehensive evaluation results. The findings provided theoretical guidance and practical implementation of effective irrigation management in regions with comparable soil textures. 4.4. Limitations Although the present study successfully established a comprehensive evaluation system for greenhouse tomato irrigation management and yielded valuable insights, certain limitations should be acknowledged. Other important variables that may affect the comprehensive evaluation, such as disease control, costs, benefits and other economic and social factors were not included in the analysis. Future studies should expand the scope of the comprehensive evaluation system to include these additional variables. Looking ahead, we plan to combine the comprehensive evaluation system with advanced process-based agroecosystem model (e.g., DSSAT and ecosys) to simulate more scenarios under climate change ( Grant, 2001 , Jones et al., 2003 ), ultimately providing prior strategies for future irrigation management ensuring efficient and sustainable water usage under water shortages. 5. Conclusion In this study, 20 indices of tomato growth, photosynthesis, yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefit were investigated to establish a comprehensive evaluation system. The TOPSIS and GRA methods, which combine weights based on game theory, were applied to assess drip irrigation schedules for greenhouse tomatoes. The comprehensive evaluation results exhibited a downward-opening paraboloid relationship with irrigation frequency and irrigation dose. The optimal ranges of frequency and dose that resulted in > 95% of the highest comprehensive value were as follows: 10.00–11.08 mm and 0.81–0.90 CE in Yulin, 13.12–15.68 mm and 0.77–0.89 CE in Yangling, and 11.44–16.40 mm and 0.67–0.77 CE in Hanzhong, respectively. Compared to other two sites with loam and silty clay soil , it is advisable to adopt a strategy of higher total irrigation amounts coupled with a more frequent irrigation schedule while maintaining lower irrigation dose in the sites with sandy loam . These findings provided theoretical guidance and practical insights to effective irrigation in northwest of China. In further studies, the advanced process-based agroecosystem model should be applied with comprehensive system to analyze more scenarios, thereby providing prior strategies for the irrigation management under climate change .

Although reducing the VPD is effective for increasing tomato yield and water productivity, regulating the VPD is costly. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of VPD regulation (high VPD=2.22 kPa, low VPD=0.95 kPa) during different growth stages on tomato WP crop , yield, and quality to identify a VPD management method that saves costs and enhances the above parameters. The results showed that the yield was significantly positively correlated with fruit calcium absorption. Decreasing the VPD during the fruit expansion stage and increasing it during the flowering stage significantly increased calcium accumulation in the fruits, thereby improving tomato WP crop , yield, and quality. Additionally, a high VPD during the flowering stage increased stomatal conductance and mesophyll conductance, thereby increasing intercellular and chloroplast CO 2 concentrations and enhancing plant photosynthetic capacity, and reduced the stem water potential, leaf water potential, and leaf relative water content, thereby increasing the water potential difference, leaf hydraulic conductance, and calcium absorption. By integrating game theory and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution method, a comprehensive analysis of tomato appearance, nutrients, and flavour quality revealed that growing plants under a high VPD during the seedling, flowering, and fruit ripening stages and a low VPD during the fruit expansion stage not only enhanced the comprehensive tomato quality value but also maximally reduced the humidification cost. Conclusively, controlling the environmental VPD at 2.22 kPa during the seedling, flowering, and fruit ripening stages and at 0.95 kPa during the fruit expansion stage can effectively increase tomato WP crop , yield, and quality. This study provides a theoretical basis for the environmental regulation of high-quality, efficient, and water-conserving cultivation of greenhouse tomatoes. Optimizing deficit drip irrigation to improve yield,quality, and water productivity of apple in Loess Plateau of China 2024, Agricultural Water Management Show abstract Deficit drip irrigation is an advanced agricultural technology widely promoted and applied around the world to maintain/increase yield and quality while simultaneously minimizing water consumption. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the effects of deficit drip irrigation at different stages on apple yield, water productivity, and quality. The aim was to investigate the effects of deficit drip irrigation treatments (DDITs) on apple yield, quality, and water productivity (WP), and optimize the deficit drip irrigation strategy for apples in the Loess Plateau of China. a two-year field experiment was conducted with 17 irrigation treatments, including a control treatment (CK, full irrigation (FI)) and four DDITs (D15%, D30%, D45%, D60%) during the bud burst to leafing stage (I), flowering to fruit set stage (II), fruit expansion stage (III), and fruit maturation stage (IV). The optimal irrigation management was determined using the fuzzy Borda combined model, which was based on four different single evaluation models of the TOPSIS method, principal component analysis (PCA), grey correlation analysis (GCA), and membership function analysis (MFA). The DDITs at stage IV decreased midday leaf water potential (Ψs) by 2.57–20.00% compared with CK, and the difference of Ψs between IV-D30%, IV-D45%, IV-D60%, and CK were significant in two years (P<0.05). DDITs at stages I, II, and IV improved fruit weight (FW), fruit shape index (FSI), and fruit firmness (FN), but did not significantly affect fruit water content (FWC). The DDITs at stages III and IV significantly enhanced total soluble solids (TSS), soluble sugars (SS), and vitamin C (V c ) in 2021 and 2022, but a notable decrease in titratable acidity (TA) was observed. DDITs at stage IV exhibited the highest comprehensive benefit of apple, followed by DDITs at stages I and II, and DDITs at stage III had the lowest values. The DDITs of D15%, D30%, CK, and D15% at stages I, II, III, and IV were identified as the optimal irrigation strategy to improve apple yield, quality, and WP. Our findings can guide the development of appropriate irrigation strategies for apple cultivation in Loess Plateau of China, promoting efficient and sustainable apple production.
